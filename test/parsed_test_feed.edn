Есть 8 лет опыта преподавания в другой области, есть действующий бизнес в сфере маркетинга, и соответственно, сотрудники, которые занимаются визуализацией контента (презентации, видеоролики). Но нет хорошего разработчика, а учить других на примере своего кода я не имею морального права, потому что не могу назвать себя профессионалом, несмотря на 6 лет хобби-программирования. Соответственно, ищу разработчика для создания кодовой базы, на основе которой будет построен курс. Уточню, что речь не идет о составлении самого курса, работе с людьми и так далее. Это все - моя забота. Задача, которую я хотел бы обсудить с вами - это только написание кода. Кода, естественно, чистого и хорошо документированного, с docstrings. Python 3, без анахронизмов.

Core features for this app include submitting forms, managing the status of the students/TAs/mentors (accepted/rejected), managing emails to participants, receiving payment from participants through Stripe. In addition to the user facing app, we would like an admin panel where the structured data (applications, student records) can be modified by a handful of superusers. We expect a deliverable of source code as well as a working install of the app on AWS with a development site and a release site.
