Last year, we taught computational neuroscience to 1700 students from around the world, and we're doing it again this year.\n\nWe need a user-facing portal to manage applications and status for three different types of roles: student, TA, and mentor. Core features for this app include submitting forms, managing the status of the students/TAs/mentors (accepted/rejected), managing emails to participants, receiving payment from participants through Stripe. In addition to the user facing app, we would like an admin panel where the structured data (applications, student records) can be modified by a handful of superusers. We expect a deliverable of source code as well as a working install of the app on AWS with a development site and a release site.\n\nTechnology-wise, we are heavily invested in Python, and we believe this is a good use case for Django. On the front-end, our static website is in React, so we have templates and components that can be re-used if that is the route chosen, but we are not tied to React if a faster development route (e.g. Django admin features) can be identified.\n\nOur expectation is that this is a 6 to 8-developer-week project, with a mid-project deliverable consisting of the demonstration of the student application form submission and management workflow.\n\nHere is a more detailed user workflow document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Em6wyetAYA5-D6BP9-um5L_7YkcYRQG6eVO5eowo-RE/edit?usp=sharing", :country "Canada"} {:category "Back-End Development", :date #inst "2021-02-10T16:48:27.000-00:00", :title "Create a small Django microservices application to handle user authentication", :link "https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-small-Django-microservices-application-handle-user-authentication_%7E01fb332342a37b3f81?source=rss", :id "7E01fb332342a37b3f81", :budget 0, :posted-on "February 10, 2021 16:48 UTC", :body "Hello, we have a small project and we are looking for a Django developer to help us.
