                        We are open to a variety of techniques including using Selenium Chromedriver, using an httpclient and processing strings, using another framework or aprroach.<br /><br />
                        There are 2 pages we need to scrape.&#160;&#160;The first a is a job listing page, the second is a company profile page (we do not need to scrape the job listings page)<br /><br />

                        There are 7 inputs to the function (posted date, location, etc.) and there are 5 - 7 outputs (name, title, etc.)<br /><br />
                        This task involves:<br />
                        understanding the inputs and creating a C# data structure <br />
                        understanding how the URL or UI is associated with input search parameters<br />

                      We need a user-facing portal to manage applications and status for three different types of roles: student, TA, and mentor. Core features for this app include submitting forms, managing the status of the students/TAs/mentors (accepted/rejected), managing emails to participants, receiving payment from participants through Stripe. In addition to the user facing app, we would like an admin panel where the structured data (applications, student records) can be modified by a handful of superusers. We expect a deliverable of source code as well as a working install of the app on AWS with a development site and a release site.<br /><br />
                      Technology-wise, we are heavily invested in Python, and we believe this is a good use case for Django. On the front-end, our static website is in React, so we have templates and components that can be re-used if that is the route chosen, but we are not tied to React if a faster development route (e.g. Django admin features) can be identified.<br /><br />
                      Our expectation is that this is a 6 to 8-developer-week project, with a mid-project deliverable consisting of the demonstration of the student application form submission and management workflow.<br /><br />

We do NOT want just an html version of our newsletter: we want it editable as a send-in-blue template.<br /><br />
                        Our target group are people in the creative industries so accurate implementation of the design is imperative. Once the design is implemented we will almost certainly need minor tweaking so please consider that when you give us your quote. <br /><br />
                        I look forward to hearing from you!<br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: February 10, 2021 10:46 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Front-End Development<br /><b>Skills</b>:Template Markups,     CSS,     HTML,     Django
